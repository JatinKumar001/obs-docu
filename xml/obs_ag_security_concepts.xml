  <title>General Paradigm</title>
  <para>The general paradigm of &obs; is to host all content on its own. Every part 
        required to rebuild a package is hosted in &obs; to guarantee reproducibility.
        This includes the ability to rebuild the build environement.
        However, optional services to integrate remote resources exist as well. These resources
        are either mirrored and stored in revision control system or just cached.
        </para>
  <sect2 xml:id="network_setup">
   <title>Frontend</title>
   <para>The API and web interface frontends is the only part which must be accessible from
	   public network. A SSL/TLS certificate is highly recommended.</para>

    <title>Access to Mirror Servers</title>
    <para>The following services require access to stage servers. These servers
          can be used to publish content without the need to make &obs; server parts
          public available.</para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>The publisher is used to publish any build results to the stage servers. It
            needs access for rsync service to the servers.

     <listitem>
      <para>The source publisher can be used similar to publish sources belonging

   <sect3 xml:id="worker_network">
    <title>Worker network</title>
    <para>It is recommended to run the &obs; workers in an isolated network. This is
          an additional security mechanism in case of a security breach on a worker.
          This network needs access to the source and repository servers of the &obs;
          backend, but nowhere else.</para>
   </sect3>
   <sect3 xml:id="signd_network">
    <title>Signer network</title>
    <para>It is recommended to run the signd on an isolated host. The signer services
          need to stay on the &obs; backend servers, they are just used for scheduling
          sign jobs. The signd is the critical instance which hosts the single instance 
          signature key. All further keys which belong to any project are created
          by the signd, crypted with the instance key and delivered to the backend
          servers. That way the signd instance is stateless after initial setup 
          and it is enough to backup the backend servers.
          Any sign job sends the encrypted private key to the signd server which is decrypting
          it for signing the content. Access to the signd server must be limited to &obs; 
          backend server components (source server and publisher).</para>
   </sect3>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 xml:id="build_env">
   <title>Build Environment</title>
   <para>The build environment is created by obsworker instances via the build script.
         Inside the build instances unverified and potentional harmful code is executed.
         Given that a user can run also any provided kernel the isolation must happen
         on VM layer. The only supported VM types, which are considered as secure are
         KVM and XEN VMs. The VMs prohibit any network access from the running instances.
         The build script is always creating a new file system, copies in all required
         data and executes the VM.</para>
   <para>The build results get extracted directly from the
         block device. This is done to avoid mounting it which could be used to
         breach the host kernel in the file system code by crafting the used
         filesystem during build.
         </para>
   <para>Every build also stores the used binaries inside of the <filename>_buildenv</filename> file. This
         can be used to re-create the build environment later, even when newer
         updates got released meanwhile. This requires however a maintenance setup
         to avoid that former releases get removed.
         </para>
   <para>The build tools (like rpmbuild) are running usually as non-root user, but 
         this is not a security instrument. It is only a quality mechanic to ensure that 
         source packages are rebuildable without root permissions.
         </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 xml:id="source_revision_system">
   <title>Source Revision System</title>
   <para>The source revision storage system is part of &obs;. The identification of sources
         still happens using MD5 sums for historic reasons. MD5 is considered to be still
         good enough for identifying a source, but it is known to be attackable. Recent
         versions of the &osc; command line tooling is sending therefore also a SHA256 sum
         in addition which is used to detect collisions by the source server.
         </para>
   <para>Sources can reference other package sources via <filename>_link</filename> files. These can be pinned
         to a revision or to always using the latest one. That way underlying changes
         get merged automatically. This is useful for shared development and automated
         builds, but it should be avoided for base projects.
         </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 xml:id="permission_handling">
   <title>Permission Handling</title>
   <para>Authorization for write operations is done via the maintainer role on package
         or project level. On project level the projects are organized in namespaces
         which are defined via colons inside the project name. A maintainer role
         on a higher namespace grants the permission to claim maintainer role on any 
         deeper project. Official projects should therefore be organized under their  own
         top level namespaces (eg. openSUSE: namespace in our reference instance).
   </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 xml:id="signature_handling">
   <title>Signature Handling</title>
   <para>Signatures are used to proof the origin of a shipment independent of
          &obs; instance. Once the <systemitem>signd</systemitem> daemon has
          been enabled by the administrator, any binary result like RPM
          packages, images, containers, or meta data gets signed.
          All &obs; instances have a master key to sign results. This master
          key has two purposes:
          First, it is used for signing if a dedicated signing key
          can not be found. Second, it is used to encrypt dedicated
          project siging keys so that they can be stored inside of the
          projects instead of on the signing server.
          If a project does not have a signing key, the build server will
          search the parent projects. This follows the logic of the write
          permission handling.
   </para>
   <para>An &obs; user (including the &obs; admin user) has only limited options
         to deal with the key setup. The user can create, delete, or extend the
         expire time of a key. It is not possible to import an external key.
         This guarantees that no key can be used outside of the
         &obs; instance to sign &obs; content.
   </para>
   <para>A SSL certificate is derived from the keys when needed (eg. for secure boot).
   </para>
   <para>GPG keypairs are created by the <systemitem>signd</systemitem> daemon. Therefore,
         it is recommened to run this daemon on a separated and protected host. The
         master key pair should exist only on this signd host. Any further
         created keypair is not stored on the signd instance, instead
         the private part is encrypted with the master key and transfered
         to the &obs; backend. Thus, the <systemitem>signd</systemitem> instance is stateless and
         needs no recuring backups after initial setup.
         All keypairs (public and private parts) are therefore part of the
         backup of the &obs; backend servers. The sign executable is
         transfering just the hash to be signed (not the entire file content) together
         with the crypted private key to <systemitem>signd</systemitem>. The daemon
         decrypts the private key with the master key, creates the signature, and sends it
         back to the client. The returned signature is applied to the binary by the sign
         executable afterwards.
   </para>
   <para>A compromised backend is still be a serious security incident
         since any content can be signed with any project key. The private
         keys are not compromised themselfs though.
   </para>
